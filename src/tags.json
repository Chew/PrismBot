Some people think Java 8 is very outdated, but it's actually an LTS, it's still getting updates. If one of your mods is weird and requires newer java, you can bypass this going to instance settings-Java and ticking 'Skip java compatibility checks', but be aware of potential issues, such as [random CMEs](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-149777)."
